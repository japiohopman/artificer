  "customPrompt": "To refine your prompt for a high-fidelity fantasy engine (like Midjourney v6, DALL-E 3, or Unreal Engine 5 renders), you want to focus on **lighting, texture, and atmosphere.**\n\nHere are three ways to refine the prompt depending on the specific \"vibe\" you want:\n\n### Option 1: The Cinematic & Atmospheric (Best for storytelling)\n> \"A cinematic close-up of a cunning rogue sitting in the deep shadows of a grime-streaked tavern corner. He sports a knowing, crooked smirk and a weathered leather eye patch over his left eye. His remaining eye is piercing and hyper-intelligent, gleaming in the low light. His scarred hands fluidly shuffle a deck of frayed, tea-stained playing cards. Atmosphere is thick with amber candlelight and swirling pipe smoke. 8k resolution, hyper-realistic textures, volumetric lighting, photorealistic, rendered in Unreal Engine 5.\"\n\n### Option 2: The Gritty & Detailed (Best for character design)\n> \"Hyper-detailed portrait of a fantasy gambler. A man with a roguish face, stubble, and a sharp, observant gaze. One eye is covered by a buckled black leather patch; the other is a vivid, calculating amber. He is idly bridge-shuffling a worn, vintage card deck at a heavy oak table. Intricate details on the leather of his doublet and the frayed edges of the cards. Mood: clandestine and dangerous. Soft bokeh background of a bustling medieval inn. Ray-tracing, high-fidelity, macro photography.\"\n\n### Option 3: The \"Artist’s Masterpiece\" (Best for high-concept art)\n> \"Digital painting of a legendary scoundrel. A sly, confident grin playing on his lips. One eye sharp and predatory, the other hidden by a battle-worn eye patch. He sits at a secluded corner table, his hands a blur of motion as he shuffles a deck of tarot-sized cards. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, deep shadows, gold rim-lighting on his silhouette. Artstation style, intricate textures, sharp focus, masterpiece, 8k.\"\n\n### Key Improvements Made:\n*   **Vocabulary:** Changed \"roguish-looking\" to \"cunning,\" \"scoundrel,\" or \"weathered\" to give the AI more to work with.\n*   **Lighting:** Added terms like \"chiaroscuro,\" \"volumetric lighting,\" and \"amber candlelight\" to create depth.\n*   **Texture:** Added specifics like \"frayed, tea-stained cards,\" \"buckled leather,\" and \"heavy oak table.\"\n*   **Focus:** Directed the \"camera\" to focus on the contrast between the sharp eye and the patch, which creates a stronger focal point. \n\n**Pro-tip for high-fidelity engines:** Mentioning specific technical terms like **\"Ray-tracing,\" \"Subsurface scattering\"** (for realistic skin), and **\"Global illumination\"** will often push the engine to produce a more professional, rendered look.",
