  "customPrompt": "To refine your prompt for a high-fidelity engine (like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or DALL-E 3), it is best to focus on **texture, lighting, specific artistic styles, and evocative adjectives** while translating the \"flirting\" and \"outstanding body\" elements into more professional aesthetic descriptions like \"graceful silhouette,\" \"alluring presence,\" or \"athletic physique.\"\n\nHere are four ways to refine your prompt, depending on the specific \"look\" you want:\n\n### Option 1: The Cinematic & Atmospheric (Best for Midjourney)\n> **Prompt:** A cinematic portrait of a youthful female bard with a lithe, graceful physique, captured in a moment of soulful performance. She has a captivating, playful smile and a wistful, faraway look in her expressive eyes. She cradles a weathered, antique wooden lute with visible wood grain and wear. She wears elegant but travel-worn leather and silk bardic attire that accentuates her athletic form. Warm, golden-hour lighting with floating embers, soft-focus background of ancient stone ruins, hyper-realistic textures, 8k, Unreal Engine 5 render.\n\n### Option 2: The Vibrant & Epic Fantasy (Best for DALL-E 3)\n> **Prompt:** A high-fantasy illustration of a cheerful young bard singing legendary ballads. She has an alluring and confident presence, standing in a sun-drenched meadow. She holds a masterfully detailed, aged lute. Her expression is a mix of joy and deep nostalgia. She is dressed in ornate, form-fitting green and gold adventurer’s clothes that highlight her toned silhouette. Intricate jewelry, wind-blown hair, magical particles in the air, vibrant colors, digital art style, highly detailed.\n\n### Option 3: The Gritty & Realistic (Best for Stable Diffusion/SDXL)\n> **Prompt:** Photorealistic fantasy photography of a beautiful young minstrel. She possesses a charming, flirtatious gaze and a slender, athletic build. She is leaning against a tavern wall, strumming a battered, vintage lute. Her eyes are unfocused as if seeing visions of forgotten heroes. Sharp focus on skin texture, fine fabric weaves of her bodice, and the scratches on the lute’s varnish. Moody rim lighting, volumetric fog, shallow depth of field, professional color grading, masterpiece.\n\n### Option 4: The Stylized \"Legendary\" Look\n> **Prompt:** A stunning fantasy character concept of a female bard, youthful and radiant with a playful, magnetic energy. She has a graceful, lithe body and wears form-fitting rustic tunics. She is performing a song of ancient evils; her expression is haunting yet cheerful. Her lute is a relic of old wood and silver strings. Artstation style, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, intricate filigree details, heavy atmosphere, epic scale.\n\n---\n\n### Key Improvements Made:\n*   **The Lute:** Changed from \"worn\" to \"weathered,\" \"antique,\" or \"scratched varnish\" to give the AI more texture to work with.\n*   **The Body:** Translated \"outstanding body\" into \"lithe, athletic build,\" \"graceful silhouette,\" or \"toned form-fitting attire.\" This helps the AI understand the aesthetic without triggering safety filters or generating generic/low-quality results.\n*   **The Expression:** Combined \"cheerful\" and \"faraway look\" into a more complex emotional state (\"wistful,\" \"soulful,\" or \"magnetic energy\").\n*   **The Setting:** Added backgrounds like \"ancient stone ruins\" or \"sun-drenched meadows\" to give the character context.\n*   **Technical Tags:** Added keywords like \"Unreal Engine 5,\" \"8k,\" \"rim lighting,\" and \"volumetric fog\" to signal the high-fidelity requirement.",
