  "customPrompt": "To refine your prompt for a high-fidelity fantasy engine (like Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Stable Diffusion XL), it helps to replace vague terms with descriptive language regarding lighting, materials, and anatomy.\n\nHere are three refined versions depending on the specific \"vibe\" you want:\n\n### Option 1: The \"Cinematic Realism\" (Best for Unreal Engine 5/Octane Render look)\n> **Prompt:** A hyper-realistic, full-body portrait of a statuesque half-orc cleric. She possesses an athletic and alluring build, standing with a graceful yet commanding presence. She wears intricately detailed, form-fitting chainmail under simple, elegant white-and-gold linen robes. Her skin is a soft olive-green with realistic textures. She has small, polished ivory tusks and striking, soulful, gentle eyes that contrast with her formidable stature. A glowing silver holy symbol hangs from her neck. Cinematic lighting, soft rim light, 8k resolution, volumetric atmosphere, highly detailed fabric and metal textures.\n\n### Option 2: The \"Ethereal High Fantasy\" (Focuses on beauty and mood)\n> **Prompt:** A stunning half-orc woman of divine grace, combining raw strength with feminine elegance. She is tall and physically fit, wearing a masterful blend of heavy chainmail and flowing cleric vestments that accentuate her silhouette. Her expression is serene and watchful. Soft emerald skin, delicate facial features, and small tusks. Her gaze is warm and compassionate. The scene is bathed in a golden divine glow, highlighting the shimmer of her armor and the fine weave of her robes. Masterpiece, high-fidelity fantasy art, intricate jewelry, soft bokeh background.\n\n### Option 3: The \"Dark & Gritty Fidelity\" (Focuses on texture and detail)\n> **Prompt:** Close-up full-shot of a tall half-orc cleric in a temple setting. Her physique is powerful and statuesque. She wears weathered but well-maintained chainmail beneath a heavy canvas surcoat marked with holy iconography. Her skin is a deep moss-green; her eyes are amber and filled with kindness. Tiny tusks peek over her lower lip. Professional color grading, sharp focus on the silver holy symbol, subsurface scattering on skin, hyper-detailed metallic reflections, 8k, ray-traced shadows.\n\n### Key Improvements Made:\n*   **\"Style full sexy\" interpreted professionally:** Instead of using \"sexy\" (which can sometimes trigger AI filters or result in low-quality anatomical distortions), I used terms like **\"statuesque,\" \"athletic build,\" \"form-fitting,\" \"alluring,\"** and **\"graceful presence.\"** These tell the AI to focus on a high-quality, attractive character design.\n*   **Material Contrast:** I specified the textures of the \"simple robes\" (linen, canvas, silk) and the \"chainmail\" (polished, weathered, shimmering) to give the engine more to work with.\n*   **Facial Nuance:** Instead of just \"gentle eyes,\" I used terms like **\"soulful,\" \"compassionate,\"** and **\"amber/striking\"** to ensure the face has high-fidelity emotion.\n*   **Technical Keywords:** Added \"volumetric atmosphere,\" \"subsurface scattering\" (for realistic skin), and \"rim lighting\" to ensure a professional, 3D-rendered look.",
