  "customPrompt": "To get the best results from a high-fidelity engine (like Midjourney v6, Unreal Engine 5, or Stable Diffusion XL), you need to translate \"personality traits\" into visual cues.\n\nHere are three ways to refine your prompt, depending on the specific \"vibe\" you want:\n\n### Option 1: The Cinematic Tavern Scene (Focus on Mood & Lighting)\n> **Prompt:** A hyper-realistic cinematic portrait of a merry Halfling traveler seated in a sun-drenched medieval tavern. He wears a heavy, weathered canvas cloak layered with road dust and fine grit. His oversized leather rucksack rests beside him, bursting with rolled parchment maps, brass astrolabes, and glowing curiosities. The halfling is captured mid-laugh, head tilted back, with expressive crow’s feet around twinkling eyes and a jovial, charismatic expression. Warm volumetric lighting, motes of dust dancing in light beams, shallow depth of field, 8k resolution, shot on 35mm lens, intricate textures of wool and aged paper.\n\n### Option 2: The \"Explorer\" Character Study (Focus on Detail & Gear)\n> **Prompt:** Full-body character concept art of a Halfling wanderer. He wears practical travel attire: a soot-stained green cloak, buckled leather boots, and a vest with many pockets. His massive backpack is a focal point, featuring visible scroll cases, dangling compasses, and exotic trinkets from distant lands. He has a sharp, clever face and an infectious, wide grin. High-fidelity textures showing the weave of the fabric and the weathered grain of leather. Sharp focus, neutral atmospheric background, hyper-detailed facial features, Unreal Engine 5 render, masterwork quality, subsurface scattering on skin.\n\n### Option 3: The Stylized Fantasy Epic (Focus on Story & Color)\n> **Prompt:** A vibrant fantasy illustration of a pint-sized halfling storyteller. He is gesturing grandly with a tankard in one hand, his face alive with a boisterous, quick-tongued expression. He is draped in a travel-worn, hooded mantle thick with the dust of the road. His pack is an organized chaos of cartography tools and shimmering artifacts. Background is a bustling fantasy marketplace at golden hour. Rich color palette, dramatic rim lighting, intricate filigree on brass instruments, 8k, highly polished, concept art style by Greg Rutkowski and Todd Lockwood.\n\n---\n\n### Key Improvements Made:\n*   **Texturing:** Instead of just \"dusty,\" I used \"weathered canvas,\" \"fine grit,\" and \"soot-stained\" to give the engine more to work with.\n*   **The Backpack:** Specified *what* the curiosities are (astrolabes, scroll cases, brass instruments) to prevent the AI from generating generic blobs.\n*   **The \"Laugh\":** Translated \"quick tongue and bright laugh\" into physical descriptions like \"mid-laugh,\" \"head tilted back,\" \"crow's feet,\" and \"gesturing grandly.\"\n*   **Technical Keywords:** Added \"volumetric lighting,\" \"subsurface scattering\" (for realistic skin), and \"depth of field\" to ensure a professional, high-fidelity look.",
